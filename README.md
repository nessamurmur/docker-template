## Docker Quickstart

This repo is meant as a template for building Docker images following [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/articles/dockerfile_best-practices/).

#### A long description

Include a comprehensive description of your image (in markdown format). Only one description is required; you don’t need additional descriptions for each tag. The file should also:

* Be named README.md
* Reside in the repo for the “latest” tag
* Be no longer than absolutely necessary, while still addressing all the content requirements.

In terms of content, the long description must include the following sections:

* Overview & Links
* How-to/Usage
* Issues & Contribution Info

#### Overview & links

This section should provide:

* an overview of the software contained in the image, similar to the introduction in a Wikipedia entry,

* a selection of links to outside resources that help to describe the software,

* a mandatory link to the Dockerfile.

#### How-to/usage

A section that describes how to run and use the image, including common use cases and example Dockerfiles (if applicable). Try to provide clear,step-by- step instructions wherever possible.

#### Issues & Contribution Info

In this part, point users to any resources that can help them contribute to the project. Include contribution guidelines and any specific instructions related to your development practices. Include a link to Docker’s resources for contributors. Be sure to include contact info, handles, etc. for official maintainers.

#### Issues

Include a brief section letting users know where they can go for help and how they can file issues with the repo. Point them to any specific IRC channels, issue trackers, contacts, additional “how-to” information or other resources.

#### License

Include a file, LICENSE, of any applicable license. Docker recommends using the license of the software contained in the image, provided it allows Docker, Inc. to legally build and distribute the image. Otherwise Docker recommends adopting the Expat license.
